# Rock-Paper-Scissors

I created Rock Paper Scissor game in Odin Project. At first it was a simple game that required user to input his/her choices from prompt and the results were displayed in the console. Later on during the course I revisited the project after learning how to manipulate the DOM and added a simple UI to the project. The player has to reset the game after playing five rounds of the game with the computer.
